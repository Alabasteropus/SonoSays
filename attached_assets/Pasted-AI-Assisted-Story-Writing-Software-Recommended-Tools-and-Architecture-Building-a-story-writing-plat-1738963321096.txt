AI-Assisted Story-Writing Software: Recommended Tools and Architecture
Building a story-writing platform with collaborative editing, AI assistance, and robust word-processing requires choosing the right components at each layer. Below is a structured recommendation covering the editor front-end, database integration, AI features, backend architecture, and deployment considerations.

Rich Text Editing in React
For a Google Docs–like experience in React, use a rich text editor library that offers extensive formatting capabilities (bold/italic, headings, lists, images, etc.) and ideally supports a paginated page-view layout:

Tiptap (ProseMirror) – Tiptap is a highly extensible, headless rich-text editor built on ProseMirror. It’s widely regarded as a well-rounded choice because it balances rich features with flexibility​
LIVEBLOCKS.IO
. You can customize the schema, add extensions (for tables, images, etc.), and it has community support. However, out-of-the-box it doesn’t natively handle visual pagination (page breaks), so you might need to implement a page layout component or plugin.
CKEditor 5 – CKEditor 5 is a mature WYSIWYG editor with an extensive feature set and plugin ecosystem developed over 20+ years​
LIVEBLOCKS.IO
. It has a clean UI and supports almost all word-processor features, including collaboration and track changes. CKEditor even offers a built-in pagination (page break view) feature to simulate pages – though this is a premium plugin in their paid offering​
REDDIT.COM
. The editor integrates with React and would require a license for some advanced features. It’s a great choice if you want a polished, ready-to-use solution and don’t mind the cost. Pros: very feature-rich (annotations, comments, etc.)​
CODE-B.DEV
. Cons: larger bundle size and some features (like real-time collaboration with their cloud service) are paid​
LIVEBLOCKS.IO
​
LIVEBLOCKS.IO
.
Slate or Draft.js – These are lower-level frameworks for building an editor. Draft.js (by Facebook) and Slate.js are both customizable, but they provide more of a toolkit than a fully-featured editor. For example, Draft.js can be used to implement pagination logic in React​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
, but you would have to create the page container logic yourself. These might be suitable if you need complete control and are okay implementing complex features (like page breaks) from scratch.
Lexical – Lexical (by Meta) is a newer React editor framework known for its performance and scalability. It’s plugin-based and can handle large documents efficiently. However, features like pagination or complex formatting would need to be built as custom plugins since Lexical focuses on core rich-text editing out-of-the-box. Lexical does have community plugins and Yjs integration for collaboration, so it’s an option if you prefer a modern, lightweight base and plan to extend it.
Recommendation: For most cases, Tiptap is an excellent starting point due to its balance of flexibility and features​
LIVEBLOCKS.IO
. It supports all common rich-text formatting and has community extensions for things like images, tables, etc. If visual pagination (seeing page breaks) is a strict requirement and you prefer something ready-made, consider CKEditor 5 with its pagination plugin​
REDDIT.COM
. Keep in mind CKEditor’s licensing for premium features. If you use Tiptap or a similar editor without native pagination, you can implement a page view by measuring content height and inserting manual breaks (there are community discussions about this) or by dividing content into multiple editor instances representing pages. In summary, Tiptap (ProseMirror) for open-source flexibility or CKEditor 5 for out-of-the-box Word-like functionality are the top choices.

Storing and Retrieving Documents with PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL will serve as the central document store. Each story/document can be stored in the database, along with metadata (title, author, timestamps, etc.). The key considerations are how to store the rich text content and how to retrieve it efficiently:

Document Format: Store the document in a non-lossy format to preserve all formatting and structure. If you use a structured editor (like ProseMirror/Tiptap, Draft.js, or Slate), these typically have a JSON representation of the document state. You can store that JSON in a PostgreSQL JSONB column. This approach is proven and avoids losing any data – for example, developers using ProseMirror report that they “use toJSON for storage (with Postgres JSONB)” and strongly advise against converting to a lossy format like HTML for storage​
DISCUSS.PROSEMIRROR.NET
. Storing JSON allows you to reconstruct the exact editor state when loading the document for editing. If your editor output is HTML or Markdown, you can store that as text, but JSON from the editor’s state is preferable for fidelity.
Document Size: PostgreSQL can comfortably handle large text fields (up to several MBs) in a single row, so a typical story or book can be stored as one record. If documents could become extremely large (dozens of MBs), you might consider splitting them (e.g., by chapters) into separate records or using an external storage for the bulk text. However, for most story-writing use cases, a single JSONB or TEXT field per document is fine.
Indexes and Queries: For retrieving documents by ID or by author, normal indexing on those fields is sufficient. If you need to support searching within documents (e.g., find all documents containing a certain word or allowing users to search their content), consider using PostgreSQL’s Full-Text Search capabilities. You can store a generated tsvector for the document content to enable fast keyword searches​
REDDIT.COM
. Another approach for more advanced search (especially semantic search, discussed below) is to use embeddings and the pgvector extension.
Versioning and Backups: If you want to keep revision history (every save or significant edit), you could have a related table for document versions or use PostgreSQL’s JSONB versioning (or even Git-like storage of diffs). This can be added later if needed. At minimum, ensure you have regular database backups or point-in-time recovery enabled, so no work is lost. For a small team, nightly backups of the DB might suffice.
Efficiency: Accessing a document by primary key (document ID) is very fast in Postgres. To optimize editing, you might load the document once and then send incremental updates (e.g., via WebSocket for collaboration, or periodic autosave). It’s often efficient to save only deltas or use upsert on the whole document JSON on each save, depending on the size. Given a small-team scope, even saving the whole document JSON every few seconds (for autosave) is usually fine. Still, you can debounce autosaves (e.g., save 2-5 seconds after the last change) to avoid excessive writes. PostgreSQL will handle concurrent writes, but if using collaborative editing with multiple users, you’ll likely be merging changes in memory (via CRDT/OT) and then writing the final result, rather than doing simultaneous writes from different users directly.
In summary, use PostgreSQL’s JSONB field to store document content in a structured form for full fidelity​
DISCUSS.PROSEMIRROR.NET
. Index by document IDs and relevant fields. Implement searching either via PostgreSQL full-text search for keywords or via embeddings for semantic search (described next). This setup will reliably store and retrieve documents for your application.

AI-Assisted Reading and Writing
Integrating AI will enhance both reading (e.g. summarizing or answering questions about the text) and writing (e.g. generating suggestions or continuing the story). There are a few key AI features to consider: document retrieval, summarization, and text generation. Here are the best strategies for each:

Semantic Document Retrieval: Instead of simple keyword search, use AI embeddings to enable semantic searches and context retrieval. A common approach is to split documents into chunks (paragraphs or sections) and generate a numeric embedding vector for each chunk using a model (for example, OpenAI’s text-embedding-ADA or similar). You can then store these vectors in PostgreSQL using the pgvector extension, which adds a vector data type and indexing for similarity search​
CRUNCHYDATA.COM
. This allows you to find relevant pieces of text by meaning, not just exact wording. For example, if a user asks a question about the story, you convert the question to a vector and query Postgres for the nearest vector chunks (the most semantically relevant passages). This Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern involves steps like: 1) get the query’s embedding, 2) find the top-N closest document chunks, 3) concatenate those chunks as context, and 4) feed them to a language model to answer or summarize​
CRUNCHYDATA.COM
. By citing the Crunchy Data example: “Lookup the embedding vector for the query, find the 5 closest entries, pull their text into one context, and run the query against an LLM with that context”​
CRUNCHYDATA.COM
. In practice, this means your backend can answer questions about the story or fetch relevant info for the AI to use when writing continuations.

Summarization: To get summaries of a long document (or chapters), you’ll likely use an LLM (Large Language Model). If the story is short enough to fit in the model’s context window (e.g., a few thousand tokens), you can send the whole text to an API like OpenAI’s GPT-4 with a prompt to summarize. For longer texts (e.g., a novel), use a divide-and-conquer strategy. One proven technique is Map-Reduce summarization: break the document into smaller chunks, summarize each chunk, then summarize those summaries into a final summary​
DEV.TO
. This approach gets around token limits. For instance: “The technique is called MapReduce. It’s based on dividing the text into a collection of smaller texts that fit in the context window and then summarizing each part separately.”​
DEV.TO
. You can automate this with libraries like LangChain which provide out-of-the-box implementations of these summarization strategies. Alternatively, you might generate an outline by summarizing each chapter or scene. The AI summarization could be on-demand (when a user clicks “Summarize”) or precomputed and stored (e.g., store a summary in the DB and update it when the doc changes significantly).

Text Generation (Writing Assistance): For helping writers, you can integrate generative AI in several ways:

Next-sentence or Continuation Suggestions: Use an LLM to continue the story from the current point. For example, send the model the last few paragraphs or an outline of the story and prompt it to suggest the next sentence/paragraph. The user can then accept or edit this suggestion.
Rewrite or Paraphrase: Allow the user to select a passage and ask the AI to rephrase, expand, or adjust tone. This can be done by prompting an LLM with instructions (e.g., “rewrite this in a more suspenseful tone”).
Guidance and Q&A: The user could ask the AI questions about the story (consistency checks, character info) and using the retrieval method above, the AI can answer based on the story content. This helps in maintaining continuity in the narrative.
Summaries and Analysis: The AI can generate a summary of the story so far, or a synopsis of each character’s arc, which can help authors keep track of complex plots.
When integrating generation, ensure you use a reliable AI provider or model. OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-3.5 is a popular choice for quality output (with an API), whereas open-source models (like GPT-NeoX, LLaMA variants) can be run on your own server for privacy, but may require significant resources and tuning. For a small-team application, using a hosted API (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, etc.) is convenient – you’d call the API from your backend whenever AI assistance is needed. Just make sure to cache results when appropriate (for instance, if two users request a summary of the same document, reuse it) to save on API costs and latency.

Tooling: Consider using an AI orchestration library like LangChain or LlamaIndex. These can simplify tasks like chunking text, managing prompt templates, and chaining the retrieval + generation steps. They also support multiple backends (OpenAI, local models, etc.), which future-proofs your solution if you switch providers. For example, you could set up a LangChain pipeline where a question triggers a Postgres vector search for context, and then feeds context + question to the LLM for an answer.

In summary, leverage embeddings and pgvector on Postgres for smart document retrieval and context for the AI​
CRUNCHYDATA.COM
, use LLMs for summarization (with chunking strategies for long texts)​
DEV.TO
, and integrate text generation via a reliable API. This combination will enable powerful AI-assisted reading (quick understanding of documents) and writing (suggestions and automation) capabilities in your software.

Backend Architecture & Collaboration
To glue the front-end and database together and to enable collaboration, design a robust backend API and real-time service. The backend will handle document management (CRUD operations, permissions), collaboration (synchronizing edits between users), and integrate the AI services. Key considerations:

API Design: A RESTful API is typically sufficient for document management. Define endpoints for actions like: create a new document, get a document (or list of documents) for a user, save edits, etc. For example, GET /documents/:id, POST /documents (to create), PUT /documents/:id (to update content or metadata), etc. Ensure you include proper authentication (e.g., a JWT or session token) so only authorized users can access their documents. Alternatively, a GraphQL API could be used, which is flexible for querying nested data (maybe fetching a document and all comments in one call). GraphQL also has subscriptions which can help with real-time updates, but setting up a separate real-time channel (WebSocket) might be simpler for collaborative editing events.

Real-time Collaboration: For multiple people editing the same story simultaneously (Google Docs style), implement a real-time synchronization mechanism. The best practice today is to use CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) like Y.js. Many modern editors (Tiptap, Lexical, etc.) have Y.js integration for real-time collaboration​
LIVEBLOCKS.IO
. Y.js will handle merging changes from different users without conflicts, even if users go offline and come back (it can merge divergent changes). To use Y.js in your app, you need a WebSocket server that broadcasts changes to all clients editing the document. You can use Hocuspocus (a Node.js package from the Tiptap team) which is essentially a ready-made WebSocket backend for Y.js documents. As the Liveblocks team notes, most editors support Yjs for collaboration, but you still need a backend service to coordinate it​
LIVEBLOCKS.IO
. The Yjs approach means each client applies operations locally and the CRDT ensures eventual consistency for all. Another advantage is that minimal data (diffs) are sent over the wire, making it efficient.

If you prefer an alternative, there is also Operational Transform (OT) which was historically used (e.g., in Google’s implementation and in libraries like ShareDB). OT works but can be more complex to implement custom. Since Y.js is readily available and well-tested, it’s a great choice for a small team project.

Tip: Start with a simple collaboration model: if real-time editing by multiple users is a requirement, implement Yjs + WebSocket from the get-go. If it’s a lesser priority, you could initially lock the document for single-user editing (to avoid conflicts) and add real-time later. However, integrating Yjs early is easier than refactoring later.

Document Management & Persistence: Your backend should enforce access control – e.g., only the owner or collaborators of a document can fetch or edit it. Keep a mapping of document permissions (for a small team, perhaps everyone can see all documents, or specific sharing settings per doc). With Y.js collaboration, typically the document is loaded on the server when the first user opens it, and kept in memory (in the Y.js model) during the editing session. To persist changes to PostgreSQL (so they aren’t lost if the server restarts or no one has it open), you can periodically save the document. For instance, use the Y.js “document update” event to save the latest content (in JSON) to Postgres every few seconds or after a certain number of changes. This way, if all collaborators disconnect, the last state is saved. You might also save a final copy when the last editor closes the document. The Tiptap/Hocuspocus ecosystem provides a Persistence extension that can save to a database; or you can manually call toJSON() on the editor document and store it.

Additionally, manage document metadata (like title, last edited time, etc.) in separate fields or a separate table for quick lookup without loading full content.

Integrating AI in the Backend: The backend API will also have to expose endpoints for AI features. For example: POST /documents/:id/summarize could trigger a summarization of that document (the backend would then call the AI service and return the result). Or POST /documents/:id/generate with some parameters could return a generated continuation. Depending on usage, these might also be WebSocket events (if you want streaming responses or to show the text being generated live). A microservice pattern could be useful here: you might have a separate module or service for AI, especially if using heavy models locally. But for a small team and simpler architecture, the same backend can handle calling external AI APIs.

Technology Stack: Implement the backend in a language/environment your team is comfortable with. Popular choices are Node.js (with Express or NestJS) for seamless sharing of types with a React front-end, or Python (Flask/FastAPI or Django) for powerful AI libraries integration. Node has the advantage of existing packages like Hocuspocus (Yjs server) and can easily call out to AI APIs as well. If you use Node, you can also consider Apollo Server for GraphQL if going that route. Ensure whichever server you build can handle WebSocket connections (for example, using libraries like Socket.IO or ws in Node, or using Django Channels in Python). The collaboration service can be the same server or a dedicated process – for simplicity, many put the WebSocket server in the same codebase as the REST API (just different endpoints/protocols).

Scalability for Collaboration: Since the use case is a small team, you likely don’t need to worry about massive scale. A single backend instance can handle multiple collaborative documents concurrently. Y.js is efficient and can handle many peers. But do design with fault tolerance in mind: for example, if the server restarts, it should load the latest document states from the database so editing can resume without data loss. If in the future the team grows, you might need to allow multiple server instances (which complicates real-time sync unless you have a broker). But for now, a single-instance server (or sticky-session if behind a load balancer) is fine.

In summary, use a REST/GraphQL API for core CRUD operations and a WebSocket-based sync for live collaboration. Implement real-time editing via Y.js (CRDT) to merge changes seamlessly​
TIPTAP.DEV
 – this provides Google Docs–style multi-user editing. The backend will manage persistence to Postgres and coordinate AI requests. Make sure to enforce authentication on all endpoints and to structure your code so that it’s clear which module handles docs vs. collaboration vs. AI.

Deployment, Security, and Efficiency for a Small Team
For a small-team application, you can keep the deployment relatively simple while ensuring it’s secure and performs well. Here are best practices and options:

Deployment Model: You have the option to self-host or use a cloud service. Self-hosting (e.g., on a VM or on-premises server) gives you full control over your data – which might be important if your stories are sensitive. As the Tiptap team notes, “Self-host your documents for full control, or opt for a secure, scalable cloud” solution​
TIPTAP.DEV
. For a small team, self-hosting on a single server can be cost-effective: you could run PostgreSQL, the backend, and perhaps even serve the React app from the same machine (though running Postgres on a managed service can simplify maintenance).
Containerization: Use Docker to containerize your application components. For instance, one image for the React front-end (which could be served as static files via nginx or a CDN), one for the backend API, and possibly one for Postgres (though often for production you’d use a managed Postgres or a separate instance). Docker Compose can help orchestrate these for development and even for deployment if sticking to a single host. Containerization makes it easy to deploy consistently on any cloud VM or to move to Kubernetes later if needed.
Cloud Services: If you prefer not to manage servers, consider platforms like Heroku, Railway, or Render for hosting the Node/Python backend (these services can also host a Postgres database for you). The React front-end can be hosted on Vercel, Netlify, or even GitHub Pages (if it’s purely static after build). Managed services take care of scaling and security updates, which is helpful for a small team without a dedicated ops person.
Security Best Practices: Ensure all traffic is encrypted – serve your site and API over HTTPS only​
REDDIT.COM
. If deploying yourself, obtain an SSL certificate (Let’s Encrypt provides free certificates) and use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy to handle HTTPS. Implement strong authentication: at minimum, use secure password hashing for user accounts or integrate SSO/OAuth if within a company. You might use an auth service or library to manage logins and JWT tokens. Also, validate and sanitize inputs on the backend to prevent SQL injection or XSS – using parameterized queries or an ORM for Postgres helps with this​
REDDIT.COM
. Since only a small group will use the app, you can also whitelist IPs or VPN access if additional security is needed.
Collaboration Security: If you implement real-time editing, secure the WebSocket connection similarly (e.g., require an auth token to connect to the collaboration server, and use WSS (secure WebSocket)). Also consider access control on document rooms – e.g., only allow users who have rights to a document to join its real-time session. The collaboration server should validate those tokens.
Performance and Efficiency: Optimize for a smooth experience rather than massive scale. For instance, use caching where it helps: the React app can cache documents in memory while editing, the backend can cache AI query results as mentioned, and you can leverage browser storage (localStorage/IndexedDB) for offline support if desired. Use a CDN to serve static assets (React bundle) for faster loads. Monitor resource usage – e.g., if using a smaller VM, ensure it has enough RAM for the AI operations (especially if running any model locally) and enough CPU for your worst-case editing bursts.
Backup and Recovery: Even for a small team, data loss is a critical concern when writing stories. Set up automated database backups (most managed Postgres services have this by default). If self-hosting Postgres, schedule daily dumps or use continuous archiving. It’s also wise to periodically export documents (e.g., to PDF or Word) as a secondary backup that users can keep. This could even be a feature in the app (export story).
Scaling Down and Up: For a small team (say 5-10 users), one server instance can likely handle everything. But plan for spikes: if you do heavy AI processing, you might want to run those tasks asynchronously (e.g., a background job queue like Bull for Node or Celery for Python to handle AI requests so the web server isn’t blocked). This ensures the app remains responsive. If the user base grows, you can scale the web/backend servers behind a load balancer and use a distributed coordination for Yjs (or stick to a single collab server with more capacity).
Testing and Staging: Since the app will be used for important content, have a staging environment where you test new features or updates (especially AI suggestions, to ensure they are appropriate) before updating production. Even for a small team, this helps catch issues early.
In conclusion, deploy on a secure, reliable setup – either self-hosted for control or a modern cloud platform for convenience​
TIPTAP.DEV
. Use Docker to simplify deployments and ensure consistency. Enforce security best practices like HTTPS, authentication, and regular backups​
REDDIT.COM
. Given the small-team scope, you can prioritize simplicity and reliability over complex scaling. This will result in a robust, secure, and efficient system for collaborative story writing.

Conclusion
Bringing it all together, a recommended stack would be: a React front-end with Tiptap (for a rich text editor that you can extend) or CKEditor 5 (for a more turnkey solution with pagination), a Node.js/Express (or similar) backend with a PostgreSQL database to store document contents (using JSONB for rich text data)​

, ensuring everyone sees changes in real time without conflict. The backend API secures and orchestrates these components, while deployment on a modest server or cloud service with proper security (HTTPS, auth, backups) keeps the system safe and performant for your team. Following these guidelines and using the best-suited tools, you’ll build a story-writing software that feels as polished as Google Docs for editing, with the added power of AI to assist your readers and writers at every step. Good luck with your project!
